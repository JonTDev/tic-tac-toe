TicTacToe React Tutorial.  Followed it then worked through all six challenges presented at the end.  First React Project.
I really enjoyed this tutorial.  I brought into light a good deal about how it all works.  I was a bit thrown off honestly as I felt like React was going to be like another language.  With it being a framework it is much less scary.  I am now really excited about the next project I built with React!
